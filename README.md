I am excited to present to you my project, **Atmosphere**, a unique YouTube channel that uses Python programming to create beautiful videos that combine classical music, art, and nature sounds to create a relaxing and immersive atmosphere.

Atmosphere was developed by **Ana Vitória Selista**, a data science student and art appreciation enthusiast who wanted to bring the beauty of classical music and fine art to a wider audience. Using the movie.py library in Python, the program creates videos with the desired length, piece of art, and ambience.

The concept behind Atmosphere is simple: we use pieces of art from **Google Arts** as background, classical music from **Youtube Audio Library**, and natural sounds like rain, birds, and more to create a fine ambience that can help you in work, studies, or simply just for reading.

In addition to being a source of relaxation and beauty, the classical music and ambient sounds used in Atmosphere's videos can also have a positive impact on the brain. Studies have found that listening to classical music can enhance cognitive functions, including memory and attention.

I take great pride in the quality of the videos and am constantly working to improve and expand the collection.

>Future implementations:   

*   **Jira integration**: I'm working on connecting the code with Jira in order to create a list of videos to be created with their related contents.

>Atmosphere is a complex Python program, and if it were to be made publicly available, it could be easily cloned or monetized. The code for Atmosphere is a valuable asset that has been carefully developed and optimized over time to ensure the highest level of performance and reliability. For this reason, the decision to keep the code for Atmosphere closed-source is a strategic one.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my project. I'm looking forward to seeing your feedback, and feel welcome to use and enjoy Atmosphere on YouTube!
